Tech Stack: PERN - PostgreSQL, Express, React, Node.js

Goal is to make a evenly focused full stack single page website for bug tracking.
Website should be able to track bugs through the lifecycle of a project. 
Bug will be submitted, approved, set to in progress, tested, submitted for released, and released.
Feature set should include assigning bugs to a person and comment capture for bugs.

Demographic is any person or company that wants to track bugs before or after a project released.

Create an api that serves up bug status being tracked in a PostgreSQL database.

Users should be regular for submission and admin to approve and add and delete users.
